Intelligent Cyberbullying Identification in Bengali TextsA machine learning-based approach to detecting and classifying offensive content in the Bengali language. This project addresses the gap in publicly available resources for Bengali NLP by introducing a custom-curated dataset and a robust classification pipeline.🚀 Project OverviewCyberbullying in regional languages presents unique linguistic challenges. This system identifies whether a given Bengali text is Hateful (offensive) or Neutral (non-offensive) using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and supervised learning.Key FeaturesCustom Dataset: 4,501 manually annotated text samples.Bengali NLP Pipeline: Specialized cleaning, normalization, and stopword removal for the Bengali script.Vectorization: Feature extraction using TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency).Multi-Model Testing: Comparative analysis of various Machine Learning classifiers.📊 Dataset DetailsThe dataset consists of 4,501 annotated samples collected from various social media and online platforms.MetricDetailsTotal Samples4,501LanguageBengaliClasses2 (Hateful vs. Neutral)Class Balance~55% Offensive / 45% Non-offensiveTarget Labels1 (Hateful), 0 (Neutral)🏗️ System ArchitectureThe workflow is designed for scalability and can be updated as more data becomes available:Preprocessing: Noise removal, character normalization, and Bengali-specific stopword filtering.Feature Engineering: Converting raw text into numerical representations using TF-IDF.Model Training: Training and testing multiple ML models to identify the highest-performing architecture.Inference: A prediction interface that classifies new, unseen Bengali text.Visualization: Performance reports and charts to analyze model accuracy and error rates.📅 Development RoadmapPhaseTaskStatusPhase 1Data collection and manual annotation✅ CompletePhase 2Text preprocessing and normalization🛠️ In ProgressPhase 3Feature extraction and initial model training📅 UpcomingPhase 4Model tuning and performance optimization📅 UpcomingPhase 5Interface development and final testing📅 Upcoming📚 Reference StudiesThis project builds upon methodologies discussed in:Bangla Cyberbullying Detection using Machine Learning and Text MiningNLP Techniques for Bangla Cyberbullying Identification🛠️ Tech StackLanguage: PythonLibraries: Pandas, Scikit-learn, NLTK (or BNLTK for Bengali support)Environment: Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab
